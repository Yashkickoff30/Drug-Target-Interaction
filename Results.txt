Single Task Leanring - Results
	
	Since there are 110 targets, 110 models for each of STL models are generated.

-> Random Forests
	
	-> Mean score for RF during training = 0.898134
	-> Performance for RF = 0.648058
	-> Duration per 1000 predictions = 28.236080788830364
	-> Mean per target R2-score for RF = 0.5016 and std = 0.1679

-> Lasso Regression 
		
	-> Mean score for LR during training = 0.752432
	-> Performance for NN = 0.576625
	-> Duration per 1000 predictions = 0.2665165828292855
	-> Mean per target R2-score for LR = 0.4190 and std = 0.2135

-> Neural Networks

	-> Mean score for NN during training = 0.993015
	-> Performance for LR = 0.591053
	-> Duration per 1000 predictions = 1.2484805806771009
	-> Mean per target R2-score for NN = 0.3892 and std = 0.2388

	we conclude that Random Forest is better than all the STL models in terms of prediction performance r2 score, mean per target r2 score and standard deviation.

Multi-Task Leanring - Results

	A multitask NN consists of a set of shared layers and a number of
	sub-networks with hidden layers, one per target.


-> MTL Model without Dropout

	-> Performance for MTL-D NN = 0.625907
	-> MSE- accuracy for MTL NN = 2.476941

-> MTL Model with Dropout
	
	-> Performance for MTL-D NN = 0.631359
	-> MSE- accuracy for MTL NN = 2.440843

Both produced similar results but performance of MTL with Dropout is slightly higher.

Finally a self-train model is constructed for Random Forest and MTL-Dropout.

	-> Self Train RF

		A semi-Supervised Model, where new predictions are imputed to the Drug-Target-Interaction Matrix and model gets trained with those new predictions.

		-> Overall accuracy for self-trained RF =  0.8785878550166767

	Needs to be Done
		
	-> MLTD - Self Train Model
	-> Drug Repurposing on new Drug Dataset.
