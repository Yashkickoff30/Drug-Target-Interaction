Drug Repurposing Idea

=> Take antiviral drug ids and convert them into chembl-ids
=> Conversion of SMILES to fingerprints
=> Perform Drug repurposing using Random Forest Model
=> Outer loop is target from interaction dataset
=> X-Train with antiviral fingerprint values 
=> Y-train no need
=> Train-CID with Chembl id's of antiviral drugs
=> Model is loaded for each target in the outer loop
=> Inner loop if x-new length is > 0
=> x-new -> list going to have new predicted values of interaction between antiviral drugs and existing protein targets
=> set x-new = 1 // trigger to start the loop
=> call imputer fn -> model of a single target, cids, fingerprints, threshold

	Imputer fn
	
	=> outer loop having all cid's
	=> for each cid, predict values in the model
	=> calculate h 
	=> check condition of h with threshold
	=> if condition satisfies, append new pred value with its cid to x-new list
	=> print pred and cid value => final output
